# Chesszero

ChessZero was developed in Python using the PyGame and Python chess libraries. 
The game features single-player (against the computer) and two-player gameplay. 
The single-player feature was implemented using Stockfish, which is an open source chess engine. 
Slight modifications were required to enable the engine to play our game, which has some rules different than those of ordinary chess.

## Steps to open the game:

* run chesszero.py to run game
#### Or to make exe file
* Run setup.py and build it(for help go to https://pythonprogramming.net to learn how to make exe)
* After building file follow below steps to run game
* Folder contains "chesszero.exe" inside folder "ChessZero", which is to be executed.
* The Home page of the game opens up, with options to play the game or read the relevant rules.


## TO DO LIST:
* Pawn Promotion (for sure)
* Online Game (if got time.....)
* Make better computer opponent using deep learning (again if got time.......)

### Help for step 2 and 3 will appreciated.
